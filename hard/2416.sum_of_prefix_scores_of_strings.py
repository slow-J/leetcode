    "abc" has 3 prefixes: "a", "ab", and "abc"
    There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", 2 strings with the prefix "ab", and 1 string with the prefix "abc".
    The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

    Build a trie from the words and everytime that a node is traversed during building, increment the value.
